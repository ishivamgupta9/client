# USER FORM APP CLIENT

This repository contains the client-side code for the User Form App. It is built using React.js, a popular front-end JavaScript library, and utilizes Material UI for designing the user interface.

## Features

The User Form App client consists of two pages:

1. **Main Form**: This page allows users to fill in their personal information, including their name, date of birth, email, and phone number. The form incorporates basic front-end validation to ensure the correctness of the entered data. Notably, the date of birth validation checks if the user is at least 18 years old.

2. **Submission**: Once the user fills out the form and submits it, the information is saved, and an email is sent to the form submitter. The email serves as a confirmation or notification to the user.
